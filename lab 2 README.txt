CS 452

For this lab I adapted some keyboard event code from an exercise in another class.
Functions are in place to operate a set of binary variables.
The update function first checks to see if the binary variables are true, then if the square is out of bounds, 
then if the conditions are right then the relevant vertices of the square are updated.
A call to the update function is included in the render function to ensure it is called every frame.
